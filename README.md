# Blackjack c++

This project was developed by a young IT student without much experience in programming and is a simple blackjack game with no split and no option to restart the game (just running it again).

*All rules are respected:*
 - number cards are worth their value, figures are worth ten and aces are worth 11 or 1 depending on the final sum;
 - as long as the dealer's hand is less than 17 he draws cards and during the game the dealer's first card remains hidden;
 - if the player exceeds 21 he automatically loses regardless of the dealer's sum;
 - the player wins if the dealer has more than 21 or if the dealer has a smaller sum than the player;
 - equal sums result in a draw.
